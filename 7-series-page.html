                        E23 in 1977.
                        In terms of the design of other BMW cars, it had the signature of BMW in its grill. This design
                        by Paul Bracq
                        introduced a perfect example of a perfect Bavarian design, a new symbol of a luxury car.<br>
                        Among the modern electronic systems of this car, we can mention ABS brakes and electronic
                        climate control system, as well as digital engine electronics and injection system.
                        <br>
                        In 1980, the BMW 745i was produced with a power of 252 horsepower and a maximum speed of 227
                        km/h, and in 1982, an updated model with a modified chassis, better aerodynamics and a
                        four-speed automatic transmission was released.
                        <br>
                        This generation was the beginning of one of the most successful BMW series in the future, with
                        more than 270,000 vehicles produced for more than 9 years.

                        a similar design pattern with models like E34. The twin lights and grill inherited from the
                        previous generation, but with more aerodynamics and elongation in the design
                        <br>
                        From 1987, the high-end sedan was produced with a 12-cylinder engine with a power of 300
                        horsepower, and this was the first engine of its kind to be used in German automobile
                        manufacturing. From 1989, optional equipment such as refrigerator, mobile phone, etc. were added
                        to this model, which brought luxury cars to a new level.
                        <br>
                        In 1991, for the first time in this generation, xenon lighting was used as an option in a
                        production car
                        <br>
                        And two 3- and 4-liter engines were also used for this car, and a total of 310,000 cars were
                        produced in this generation.

                        In 1994, E38 was introduced with its nineties design. In terms of design, it had more arches and
                        more elongation than the previous generation.
                        <br>
                        In terms of technology, the 7 series in this generation has many innovations, including the
                        first navigation system in European cars and a side airbag, and there are many luxury features
                        that were rare and perhaps unique in their time.
                        <br>
                        The first 7 series model to enter the market with a diesel engine. including a six-cylinder
                        engine with a power of 184 horsepower, a six-cylinder engine with a lower power of 143
                        horsepower and a V8 diesel engine with a power of 245 horsepower, which was the most powerful
                        diesel engine.
                        <br>
                        The variety of engines in this model is not only limited to diesel engines, 750i, 750iL with a
                        5.4-liter 12-cylinder gasoline engine with a power of 326 horsepower is a symbol of the power of
                        the e38 among competitors. And since 2000, the technology of hydrogen engines with the
                        production of 750 hL enters the 7 series.
                        <br>
                        In addition to the produced models of the 7 series, about 900 units were produced with a 39 cm

                        Because of its integrated SIM card, the BMW Personal Assistant has unlimited mobile access to
                        apps and services, such as the continuously updated Connected Navigation, and remote software
                        upgrades. BMW Connected represents the seamless connection between smartphone and vehicle.
                        Semi-automated parking gives the driver control of the vehicle without being in it: The BMW 7
                        series can maneuver itself into parking spaces and garages with driver supervision.

                        With the model update in 2019 the car was given a new, significantly larger radiator grille,
                        which, together with the matching headlights emphasize the width and presence of the luxury
                        sedan.

                        BMW unveiled the seventh generation of the 7 Series in 2022. There were many doubts about its
                        design before its unveiling. But after the unveiling, it was able to attract the positive
                        opinion of customers.
                        <br>
                        In this generation, the headlights have become two separate parts below each other, and the
                        upper part of the car's daytime running lights is made up of a narrow line of light.The
                        customized model of headlights is a special type called 'Iconic Glow' which contains backlit
                        Swarovski elements.
                        <br>
                        There are touch screens throughout the interior of this car, and the optional 31.3'' BMW Theater
                        Screen creates a cinematic atmosphere for the rear passengers. The combination of this space and
                        the crystal-clear sound and 4D audio of the optional Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound
                        System provides more pleasure for the rear passengers.
                        <br>
                        In this generation, hybrid and fully electric engines are produced for the first time in this
                        generation. BMW, like all major car manufacturers in the world, is changing its engines from
                        gasoline to hybrid and all-electric. The i7 is the first all-electric BMW seven-series with a
                        power of 544 horsepower and a range of 600 kilometers, which is a symbol of BMW's powerful entry
                        into the world of electric cars.
